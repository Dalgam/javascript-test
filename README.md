# Storykit Test

Create an application where you can search for movies in the database and edit the grade of them.
Our intent is not that this application should be production ready in any way.
Skip steps that you feel are gold plating for the application.

Minimum feature set:

- Search for movies in the database.
- Edit the grade (from 1 to 5) of a movie and have it updated in the database.

In addition to the solution meeting the minimum requirements, we will also assess things such as:

- Throttle requests in a manageable way.
- Handle race conditions.
- Ensure that you're utilizing TypeScript.
- Git workflow.
- Structure of html.

The delivery of your solution to us should be in the form of a repository. Private or not, it's up to you. Just make sure to invite us to your repo if it's private. Your repository can but doesn't have to be a fork of this repository.

In this repository we have provided you with a boilerplate that you can use to start if you like.
But feel free to change it and add the tools/framework etc to your liking.

## Getting started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and then run

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Documentation

For the API documentation it's available from [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

The boilerplate is built using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

# JavascriptTest Angular README

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
